# Cloud Documentation

Cloud documentation for Technology Services.

## Adding/Editing Content to this site

The documentation in this book is sourced by the markdown files and structure in `./src` and is rendered to navigable html by [mdbook](https://rust-lang.github.io/mdBook/). Github actions in this repo automatically render committed markdown and publish it.

1. Create a new branch from `main` for your changes
2. Create/Edit the markdown files in the `src` directory
3. **IMPORTANT** -- Add/Update links in the `SUMMARY.md` file to include your new content.
    - MdBook uses `SUMMARY.md` to build the sidebar of the site, and all content must be accessible from the sidebar.
    - The links in `SUMMARY.md` use relative pathing. `SUMMARY.md` is located in the root directory of `src`; the convention is `- [Page Title](./path/to/file.md)`
    - you can add as many subdirectories in `src` to logically group your pages as you like, as long as the path is correct. If a file isn't referenced correctly in `SUMMARY.md`, it will either 404 or display an empty page.
    - adding tabs to `- [Page Title](./path/to/file.md)` will create a nested list in the sidebar. For example:

        ```markdown
        - [Page Title](./path/to/file.md)
            - [Nested Page Title](./path/to/file.md)
            - [Nested Page Title](./path/to/file.md)
            - [Nested Page Title](./path/to/file.md)
        ```

        will create a list in the sidebar that looks like this:

        ```markdown
        1. Page Title       >
        ```

        that when clicked, will expand to show:

        ```markdown
        1. Page Title           v
            1.1. Nested Page Title
            1.2. Nested Page Title
            1.3. Nested Page Title
        ```

        ---
        *note:* multiple levels of nesting are supported, make sure to use the correct number of tabs to nest your pages correctly.

        ---

    - Empty links can be used (i.e. `- [Page title]()`) to create a collapsible header for nested pages in the sidebar without a link to a page. This can be used to group pages logically without creating a page for the header.

    - Unfortunately, directories cannot be linked in `SUMMARY.md` plainly. Instead, a topic subdirectory's `index.md` must be linked which renders a link to the generated `index.html` file.
4. Optional - Preview your changes before commiting and pushing to the repo. This can be done most easily by running `mdbook` locally or by running using dev containers. See [Dev Containers](#dev-containers) for more information.
5. Commit your changes
6. Push your changes to GitHub
7. Create a pull request to merge your changes into the `main` branch
    - This will trigger a GitHub Action to build and deploy a preview of your changes to GitHub Pages
8. Add a reviewer to your pull request to approve your changes
9. Once your changes are merged, GitHub Actions will build and deploy the site to GitHub Pages

## Dev Containers

### Prerequisites

More information can be found [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/devcontainers/containers) and the prerequisites for dev containers can be found [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/devcontainers/tutorial#_prerequisites).  However, the basic prerequisites are:

1. Install Visual Studio Code
2. Install Docker Desktop (or one of the alternatives)
3. Install the Dev Containers extension for Visual Studio Code

### Using Dev Containers

To open the Visual Studio Code Window in the dev container:

1. Use the 'Open remote window' button (in the bottom left corner of the  VS Code window) and select 'Reopen in Container' or use the 'Dev Containers: Reopen in Container' command from the Command Palette (F1, ⇧⌘P).
2. A new VS Code window will open and an information message saying 'Starting with Dev Containers' will display while the docker image is created and started
3. Once started, use the terminal to run `mdbook serve` to start the app
4. Navigate to '127.0.0.1:3000' or 'localhost:3000' to view and verify the content

To switch back to the local folder:

- Use the 'Open remote window' button (in the bottom left corner of the VS Code window) and select 'Reopen Folder Locally' or use the 'Dev Containers: Reopen Folder Locally' command from the Command Palette (F1, ⇧⌘P).

---
**NOTE:** The .devcontainers config is based upon [this](https://github.com/microsoft/rust-for-dotnet-devs/tree/main) repo.

## Markdown Syntax

A good reference for markdown syntax can be found [here](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/)

### Adding Images

Images can be added to the `src` directory and referenced in markdown files using relative pathing. For example, if you add an image to `src/images/image.png`, you can reference it in a markdown file using `![alt text](./images/image.png)`

### Adding Links

Links can be added to markdown files using the following syntax: `[link text](https://www.example.com)`. Internal links are supported using relative pathing, i.e. `[link text](./path/to/file.md)` (if your file is in a different directory, make sure the relative path is correct, i.e. `../../path/to/file.md`).

You can also link to a specific section of a page using the following syntax: `[link text](./path/to/file.md#section-title)` where `#section-title` is the Markdown header of the section you want to link to.

#### Special note on linking topic directories

Directory and subdirectory linking is not supported in `SUMMARY.md`. For instance, if you wanted to link `[cloud](./cloud/)`, you would see an mdbook compile error like:
```
2024-09-16 10:18:18 [ERROR] (mdbook::cmd::watch::poller): failed to load book config: Unable to read "Cloud" (/Users/bronius/projects/it-cloud-docs/src/./cloud/)

Caused by:
    Is a directory (os error 21)
```
Instead, create an `index.md` in that subdirectory, and link it directly like `[cloud](./cloud/index.md)`. This will generate an `index.html` file and link to it in the summary sidepanel. Our webserver for this documentation site is configured to serve `index.html` when no file is specified, so the subdirectory link _can be_ specified and shared without the `index.html`.

### Including other markdown files

You can include other markdown files in a markdown file using the following syntax: `{{#include path/to/file.md}}`. This is useful for including content that is shared across multiple pages, such as a disclaimer or warning.

### Adding Tables

Tables can be added to markdown files using the following syntax:

```markdown
| Column 1 | Column 2 | Column 3 |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Row 1 | Row 1 | Row 1 |
```

---
**IMPORTANT** -- formatting the content within cells of a table is not supported natively in markdown. If you need to format content within a table cell, you can use `HTML` tags to do so. For example:

---

```markdown
| Column 1 | Column 2 |
| --- | --- |
| Row 1 | <ul><li>Item 1</li><li>Item 2</li></ul> |
| Row 2 | Item 1<br>Item 2 |
```

will render as:

| Column 1 | Column 2 |
| --- | --- |
| Row 1 | <ul><li>Item 1</li><li>Item 2</li></ul> |
| Row 2 | Item 1<br>Item 2 |

You **must** keep the `|` characters on the **same line** rather than breaking them up into multiple new lines in the `.md` document for the table to build correctly.

### Adding Code Blocks

Code blocks can be added to markdown files using the following syntax:

```markdown
    ```language
    code
    ```
```

where `language` is the language of the code block. For example, to add a code block in `bash`, you would use:

```markdown
    ```bash
    echo "Hello World"
    ```
```

code blocks are copiable, meaning you can house code snippets in markdown files that users can copy and paste into their own code.

### Mdbook-admonish

This site uses the `mdbook-admonish` addon to add warning, note, and tip blocks to markdown files. For more information on `mdbook-admonish` formatting, see [the documentation](https://tommilligan.github.io/mdbook-admonish/).

The syntax for adding these blocks is as follows:

```markdown
    ```admonish <type>
    content
    ```
```

where `<type>` is one of `warning`, `note`, or `tip`.  See [directives](https://tommilligan.github.io/mdbook-admonish/reference.html#directives) for a complete list. For example:

```markdown
    ```admonish warning
    This is a warning
    ```
```

**Unlike normal codeblocks**, the content within admonish codeblocks will **keep** markdown formatting. For example:

```markdown
    ```admonish warning
    This is a **warning**
    ```
```

will display warning as **warning**.

Admonish blocks are collapsible by adding `collapsible=true` to the opening tag. For example:

```markdown
    ```admonish warning collapsible=true
    This is a warning
    ```
```

There is a custom style created for admonish blocks called `class=aggiecustom2` that is used to match the style of the rest of the site. You can also use `title=""` in the tag to generate a custom title to the collapsible block. For example:

```markdown
    ```admonish collapsible=true class=aggiecustom2 title="Your custom title"
    content
    ```
```

This is useful for creating a collapsible block to house tables or other content that you want to keep formatted in markdown, but don't want to display by default.
