# Email Security

Email security is the practice of protecting email accounts and communications from unauthorized access, loss, or compromise. Email authentication (or email validation) is the process used to verify the source and legitimacy of an email message.  When understanding email authentication and security at Texas A&M it is important to understand the email authentication protocols.

[Email Authentication Protocols](./email/protocols.md)

Texas A&M Technology Services has enabled the anti-spoofing protocol DMARC for the root tamu.edu domain.
The email authentication protocols of SPF, DKIM and DMARC have been implemented for all email received at the root '@tamu.edu' email domain. In order to further protect email and comply with upcoming requirements from large email providers like Google and Yahoo, we are expanding the use of the email authentication protocols to all subdomains (<sub-domain.tamu.edu>) that receive email.
