# Google's Postmaster Tools

Google’s Postmaster Tools serve as a valuable resource, enabling senders to troubleshoot and address deliverability issues. This tool provides crucial insights into key metrics, helping identify potential challenges in email sending practices.

According to Gmail, leveraging these tools allows for an assessment of the overall health of your email program. Even if Gmail is not your primary focus, gaining insights into how Gmail views your mail can enhance your understanding of your reputation across email platforms. Upon successful setup and activation, Google provides insights into various data points presented in distinct dashboards.

## Access and Setup

## Dashboards

```admonish note
There is a minimum daily email volume threshold for data to populate in the Google Postmaster Tools. Google doesn’t publish the specific threshold, but we’ve found that if you are sending over 100 messages per day to unique Gmail users, reputation data will be generated for that day.
```

Reports generated by Google update daily, providing insights into the prior day’s performance. All data is aggregated. Instead of giving you a score (for example, 0 to 100), Google gathers the results inside groups ranked from Bad to High.

### Spam Rate

The spam rate is the percentage of emails marked as spam by users vs emails sent to the inbox for active users. If a substantial number of emails are delivered directly to spam folders, you may see a low spam rate even though users may still be marking your inboxed emails as spam.

### IP Reputation

A higher IP reputation means emails sent from this IP are more likely to go to a recipient’s inbox instead of their spam folder. For example, if you send a lot of emails, and users mark them as spam, your IP reputation number will go down.

To reduce negative user feedback, you should regularly check your sending list. Be sure to only send emails to users who want your emails.

### Domain Reputation

A higher domain reputation means emails from your sending domain (SPF and DKIM) are less likely to get filtered to a recipient’s spam folder or inbox.

### Feedback Loop

This dashboard is available after you set up the Gmail Spam Feedback Loop (FBL). To view a table with the identifiers flagged by FBL and their corresponding spam rates, click any data point on the graph.

About FBL graphs:

- Average FBL spam rate graph: Shows average spam rate across all identifiers flagged by FBL on a given day (when applicable) over time.
- Identifier volume graph: Shows the number of unique identifiers flagged by FBL per day (when applicable) over time.

### Authentication

This dashboard shows the percentage of your emails that passed SPF, DKIM, and DMARC over all received traffic that attempted authentication.

About SPF, DKIM & DMARC graphs:

- SPF graph: Shows percentage of mail that passed SPF vs all mail from that domain that attempted SPF. This excludes any spoofed mail.
- DKIM graph: Shows percentage of mail that passed DKIM vs all mail from that domain that attempted DKIM.
- DMARC graph: Shows percentage of mail that passed DMARC alignment vs all mail received from the domain that passed either of SPF or DKIM.

### Encryption

This dashboard shows what percentage of your inbound and outbound traffic is encrypted.

About TLS inbound & outbound graphs:

- TLS Inbound: Shows percentage of incoming mail (to Gmail) that passed TLS vs all mail received from that domain.
- TLS Outbound: Shows percentage of outgoing mail (from Gmail) that was accepted over TLS vs all mail sent to that domain.

### Delivery Errors

This graph monitors what percentage of your total emails were rejected or temporarily failed as compared to all authenticated traffic. Under the graph, you can view a list of reasons an email failed.

About delivery errors:

- Rate limit exceeded: The Domain or IP is sending traffic at a suspiciously high rate and temporary rate limits have been put in place.
- Suspected spam: The traffic is suspected to be spam by our systems.
- Email content is possibly spammy: The traffic is suspected to be spammy specifically because of the content.
- Bad or unsupported attachment: Traffic contains attachments not supported by Gmail.
- DMARC policy of the sender domain: The sender domain has set up a DMARC rejection policy.
- Sending IP has a low reputation: The IP reputation of the sending IP is very low.
- Sending domain has a low reputation: The Domain reputation of the sending domain is very low.
- IP is in one or more public RBLs: The IP is listed in one or more public Real-time Blackhole Lists (RBLs). Work with the RBL to get your IP de-listed.
- Domain is in one or more public RBLs: The Domain is listed in one or more public Real-time Blackhole Lists. Work with the RBL to get your domain delisted.
- Bad or missing PTR record: The sending IP is missing a PTR record.
