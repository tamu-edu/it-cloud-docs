# DMARC

Domain-based Message Authentication, Reporting & Conformance([DMARC](https://dmarc.org)) is an email standard designed to prevent spammers from using a domain to send email without the domain ownerâ€™s permission.  DMARC helps senders and receivers determine if a messages is legitimate.  DMARC provides for is an email authentication, policy, and reporting protocol.

1) **Email Authentication** - DMARC combines the authorization and authentication results of two other protocols, SPF and DKIM, to determine whether email sent from your domain is authentic.
2) **Email Policy** - DMARC publishes a public policy instructing recipient servers how to respond if they receive email from your domain that was determined to be inauthentic.
3) **Email Reporting** - DMARC provides reporting mechanisms for domain owners to monitor, assess, and confirm that mail being sent from their domain is legitimate.

DMARC Policies are creating using a DNS TXT Record.  Here is a sample DMARC record:

```shell
v=DMARC1; p=reject; rua=mailto:postmaster@example.com, mailto:dmarc@example.com; pct=100; adkim=s; aspf=s
```

For a message to pass DMARC authentication, it must pass two steps.

1) Pass SPF and/or DKIM authentication.
2) Pass domain alignment for either SPF or DKIM, for whichever protocol passed in the first step.

```admonish info
Domain Alignment ensures that the email address in the "From:" header is the actual sender of the message. A SPF domain check ensures that the Envelope "From:" (or Return-Path address) and the "From:" header are aligned. The DKIM domain check ensures that the DKIM signing domain (`d=example.com`) aligns with the "From:" header address.
```

## DMARC Requirements

All 'tamu.edu' subdomains will inherit the root 'tamu.edu' dommain's DMARC policy. All outgoing mail or mail sent from third party mailers including cloud applications, will need to pass DMARC to ensure deiliverability.

## Check DMARC Record

The 'tamu.edu' subdomains will not have DMARC records, but will inherit from the root 'tamu.edu' domain.  To look up the 'tamu.edu' domain's DMARC record:

1) Open a console or command line on your computer.
2) Type `nslookup -q=txt _dmarc.tamu.edu`.
3) Press "Enter" to execute the command.
4) The output will display the DMARC record for the root `tamu.edu` domain.

```shell
nslookup -q=txt _dmarc.tamu.edu
Server:         128.194.254.1
Address:        128.194.254.1#53

_dmarc.tamu.edu text = "v=DMARC1;p=quarantine;sp=none;fo=1;rua=mailto:dmarc@tamu.edu;ruf=mailto:dmarc@tamu.edu"
```
