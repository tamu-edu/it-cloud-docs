Email has been a primary communication tool in the workplace for more than two decades. More than 333 billion emails are sent and received daily worldwide—and employees get an average of 120 emails a day. This spells opportunity for cybercriminals who use business email compromise attacks, malware, phishing campaigns, and a host of other methods to steal valuable information from businesses. Most cyberattacks—94 percent—begin with a malicious email. Cybercrime cost more than USD$4.1 billion in 2020, with business email compromise causing the most damage, according to the FBI’s Internet Crime Complaint Center (IC3). The consequences can be severe, leading to significant financial, data, and reputational losses.
