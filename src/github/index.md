# GitHub Overview

Texas A&M University has partnered with [GitHub](https://github.com/) to provide a code hosting platform for our community. GitHub is a place to store and share code, manage projects, and build software.

GitHub is free for all faculty, researchers, staff, and students for public and private projects.

## Getting Started

If you're new to git and GitHub or want to refresh or sharpen your skills, see our section on [Using Git and GitHub](/github/guidelines/#using-git-and-github).

To start using Texas A&M University's Enterprise GitHub, you first need a personal GitHub account. Reusing an existing account is okay if you already have one, or you can create a new one just for work. Next, you must use that account to join one of Texas A&M's two organizations:

* the [Institutional organization](https://github.com/org/tamu-edu) for faculty, staff, and research projects, and
* the [Student organization](https://github.com/org/tamu-edu-students) for instructional, classroom, and student use.

Visit the [Texas A&M University GitHub](https://github.cloud.tamu.edu) site to join, where you can create or link a GitHub account with your NetID when joining an organization.

See the [Migration](server/migration.md) page for more information about migrating repos from `github.tamu.edu`

## Student Developer Pack

If you're a student, you can sign-up for the [GitHub Student Developer Pack](https://education.github.com/pack) to get GitHub Pro features, free training, and lots of free services and software from GitHub partners.

## Educators

[GitHub Educations](https://education.github.com) has many programs specifically for educators.

### GitHub Global Campus Program

Educators can apply to join the Global Campus program to join a teachers-only community on GitHub Discussions, request swag for their classroom, manage classrooms, and access educational resources from GitHub and other community members.

Educators can also receive CodeSpaces credit to use in their GitHub Classrooms.

### GitHub Campus Advisor

[GitHub Campus Advisors](https://education.github.com/teachers/advisors) is a community for teachers who share best practices. They have mastered the use of Git and GitHub and champion the use of real-world tools at their institutions. A Campus Advisor:

* Prepares students for the real world
* Shares best practices with colleagues
* Interacts with educators beyond their campus

A Campus Advisor benefits from event support on campus or at conferences via the Campus Advisors Professional Development Network (CAPDN), early access to new education features and materials from GitHub Education, and special invitations to educational conferences and meetups around the world.

## Personal Use

Texas A&M University Enterprise GitHub is only for collaborative projects directly related to one's affiliation with Texas A&M University. Please use a personal GitHub account or organization if your project does not represent Texas A&M University or is not related to your affiliation with the University.
