### Why is two-factor authentication required?
TAMU's Duo two-factor system only protects services that require NetID authentication, and TAMU Duo protects the TAMU GitHub organizations. However, your personal GitHub - a requirement for using GitHub - is not protected by TAMU Duo. Practicing good security hygiene enables two-factor authentication everywhere, and in our opinion, this should especially include GitHub. It is also the only way to require external collaborators, not subject to TAMU Duo, to use 2FA as required by most security controls.

### How do I authenticate to tamu-edu and tamu-edu-students?
To access either organization, you must first sign in to github.com using your personal GitHub account. Our organizations are configured to redirect you to use Texas A&M University SSO whenever accessing a non-public resource in the organizations. You must authorize any Personal Access Tokens and SSH Keys in your account to access each organization before use. Read more [about authentication with SAML single sign-on](https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise-cloud@latest/authentication/authenticating-with-saml-single-sign-on/about-authentication-with-saml-single-sign-on).
