# Network Migration

On February 19th, 2024, a new network design was implemented for the TAMU AWS VPC. This new design is intended to further improve the default security posture of the AWS network configuration for the Aggie Innovation Platform (AIP). The new configuration will provide centralized firewall protection for AWS workloads, similar to how the campus network is protected by border and data center firewalls. 
  
Existing AWS accounts may or may not be impacted by this change depending on the resource types used. Any resource that uses a VPC network interface will be impacted. This includes, but is not limited to, EC2 instances, RDS instances, and Lambda functions.
 
Technology Services will be available to help all account owners migrate impacted resources, up to and including performing the migration.

For those that wish to migrate themselves, please refer to the [network specifications](./networking.md) for the new VPC design and details, and consult the guides below for specific resource types.

## Common Prerequisites

Before migrating any resources, you should complete the following steps:

1. Determine which subnet or subnets you want to move the resource to and note the subnet ID(s).
   1. If your resource is using a public IP address, it will need to use a public subnet.
   2. If your resource is currently connecting to a campus service, it will need to use a campus subnet.
      1. Email [aip@tamu.edu](mailto:aip@tamu.edu) to request a consultation before getting access to a campus subnet. 
   3. All other resources should use a private subnet.
   4. More information on the network and subnets can be found [here](https://docs.cloud.tamu.edu/cloud/aws/networking.html#reference).
2. Copy any security groups in use by your resource to the new VPC.
   1. If you are only moving the resource to a new subnet within one of the TAMU shared VPCs, you can use the same security group.
   2. If you are having to move regions or VPCs, you will need to copy the security groups. See [copying security groups](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/working-with-security-groups.html#copy-security-group) for instructions.
   3. Note the new security group ID for use in the migration process.

### General Terraform notes

If you are already managing your AWS resources via Terraform and wish to migrate using Terraform, here are some considerations to keep in mind.

- The overall pattern you will want to follow is to create new resources in your terraform code that are bound to the new, shared VPC (i.e. ALB and associated resources, subnet group for RDS, security groups, etc.) side by side with old version bound to the old VPC. Next, move the resource(s) that depends on these things to use the new resource. Lastly, delete the old resource(s) pointing to the old VPC.
- You can't update security groups in Terraform if there are resources already depending on them. Instead, create new security groups, point old resources to them, then delete old security groups.
- When creating security groups, wherever possible, don't rely on CIDR blocks if you are trying to limit access to one resource to another managaed resource. Instead, use `security_groups`. I.e. `security_groups   = [aws_security_group.<resource_name>.id]`. This will allow Amazon to use its knowledge of the resources represented by the other security group to limit access.
- See this page for [details on referencing subnets with Terraform](https://docs.cloud.tamu.edu/cloud/aws/networking.html#using-subnets-with-terraform)



### EC2 Instances

It's not possible to move an existing instance to another subnet, Availability Zone, or VPC. Instead, you can create a new Amazon Machine Image (AMI) from the source instance to manually migrate the instance. Next, use the new AMI to launch a new instance in the desired subnet, Availability Zone, or VPC. And finally, reassign any Elastic IP addresses from the source instance to the new instance. Note that if you need to migrate to a supported region, Elastic IP addresses are not portable across regions and will change.

There are two methods to migrate the instance:

- Use the AWS Systems Manager automation document [`AWSSupport-CopyEC2Instance`](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager-automation-runbooks/latest/userguide/automation-awssupport-copyec2instance.html).
- Manually create an instance image and launch a new instance from the image. 

We recommend using the AWS Systems Manager automation document to copy the instance. This method is faster and less error-prone than manually copying the instance. Please be sure to complete the common prerequisites before using the automation document. You will need to have the following information available:
- The instance ID of the source instance.
- The subnet ID of the destination subnet.
- The security group ID of the destination security group.
- (Optionally) the name of the key pair defined for the previous VM for initial login

Additional notes about using the AWS Systems Manager automation document:
- If you use this automation, you will end up with two identical VM's. This means that it is recommended to shut down the source VM before initiating the automation to prevent both VM's from running at the same time.
- Please consider what this will mean for any other systems depending on this VM. 
- At a minimum, once you are satisfied that the copy is working correctly, you will need to shut the old VM down and eventually remove it. The automation does not clean up the old VM for you.
- Pay attention to the region that is selected when running the automation document. It may not default to the correct region in which your resources are located. In particular, if the automation can't seem to find any of your resources, this is likely the cause.

Once the automation document has been run, you will need to:
- manually reassign any Elastic IP addresses from the source instance to the new instance, if applicable.
- reassign any EC2 instance roles, if applicable.
- clean up (delete/terminate) the source instance and any associated resources.
- update any DNS records or other references to the source instance.

If you were using Terraform to manage the old VM and want to continue using it to manage the new VM resource, you will need to define new resources and then import the copied VM into that. A way to get the correct syntax to use for importing is to run `terraform plan` and see how it defines the resource name. Once you have the name correct, if you were using a module for instance, import with something like `terraform import module.<module_name>.aws_instance.<resource_name> <instance_id>`. Once imported, run `terraform plan` again to see what it says will need to be changed. Observe what it would change, then update your Terraform code so unwanted changes would not occur. Keep doing this loop until the output of `terraform plan` reflects the actual changes (if any) that you want to make. Some common things that you may need to update inclued:
- AMI - you will need to update to reflect the automatically created AMI from the automation
- Key pair - set to "" if you didn't specify this when making the copy


### RDS Databases

The process for migrating an RDS database depends on whether you are migrating within the same region or to a different region. To move to another set of subnets, Availability Zones, or VPC within the same region, you can simply modify the RDS instance. To move to a different region, you can create a snapshot of the RDS instance and restore it in the new region.

To move within the same region:

1. Complete the [common prerequisites](#common-prerequisites).
2. Create a DB subnet group in the target VPC. Most databases should use private subnets in their subnet group. More information on creating subnets groups can be found [here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/USER_VPC.WorkingWithRDSInstanceinaVPC.html#USER_VPC.Subnets).
3. Due to a limitation in the AWS web console when needing to change both the subnet group and security groups, you will need to use the CLI to modify the RDS instance to use the new subnet group. Replace the values in the command below with your own values and run the command in the AWS CLI.
   
   ```
   aws rds modify-db-instance \
     --db-instance-identifier <instance-name> \
     --db-subnet-group-name <new-subnet-group-name> \
     --vpc-security-group-ids "<sg-example-1>" "<sg-example-2>" \
     --apply-immediately
   ```

### Redshift Clusters

To move a Redshift cluster to a different subnet group, you can modify the cluster to use the new subnet group. If you need to move to a different VPC, you can create a snapshot of the cluster and restore it in the new VPC.
