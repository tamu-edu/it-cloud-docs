# VPC Policy

A Service Control Policy (SCP) has been created to prevent the creation of VPCs, subnets, and other networking resources in AWS. This policy is in place to ensure that VPCs and subnets are created in a consistent and secure manner, and has been applied to all accounts in the TAMU AWS Organization. 

Most of the time this will not cause any issues and AWS resources can be created as normal. Sometimes, vendors and partners cannot account for this in their pre-designed solutions and require they create and manage the network resources. If this is the case for you, or if you need any other specific network design or resource, please contact the Cloud Services team for assistance.
