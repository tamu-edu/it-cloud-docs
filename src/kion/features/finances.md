# Budgets and Finances

Kion provides detailed insights into cloud spending, identifies ways to save money, and offers tools to control cloud costs. It helps you track spending and budgets in detail, discover ways to save money by optimizing or removing unused cloud resources, and optionally set spending limits that automatically take action if costs get too high.


## Budgets

Kion allows you to set budgets for your cloud accounts and projects. You can set budgets for specific time periods, such as monthly, quarterly, or annually. You can also set budgets for specific services, such as EC2, S3, or RDS. 

Technology Services has pre-created a budget for each project from the dollar amount that was originally requested. Historically, this provided dollar amount has been unrealistic and out of date and will need to be adjusted. 

Kion budgets are simply groups of one or more months that have been given a specific amount of spending. Most commonly, the months in a budget reflect our Fiscal Year, which runs from September 1st to August 31st. If you have a steady workload and spending pattern, you can set a budget for the entire year by allocating the same amount to each month. However, if you have a season workload, you can allocate a different amount each month to reflect the expected spending.

Kion will automatically track both your total spending *and* your spending rate based on the budget you have set. If you are spending too quickly, Kion will show you so that you can take action to slow down your spending or adjust your budget. In the example below, the green bar represents how much you have spent, and the arrow indicates where you should be based on your budget.
